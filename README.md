Everything computercraft for Minecraft

Note from Owner:
Hi guys, thankyou for visiting my repository.

For starters. You can, for any reason at all have any combination of my programs installed on the same computer. The inbuilt file management ensures that no settings files can interact with any other program than what it is meant for.
Storage scheme is as follows: "data/<programOrShorthandName>/"

I have kept file naming to lowercase as much as possible with the only exception of my APIs to (try) ensure cross platform stability.

Let me know of any issues by raising a bug report and I'll try to get to them as soon as possible.

Keep an eye on this repository for new projects. I'll keep em coming as time goes by.


Regards,
(CGB)CreeperGoBoom.
